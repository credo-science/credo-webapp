                <h3>1. I don't see some of my detections. Are you filtering them?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, we hide detections from old versions of the app and ones that are too bright because they may
                    be artifacts.
                    We also try to detect "hot pixels" that are generating false positives.
                    However, we still keep all of them and use them while analyzing data for science purposes.
                </p>
                <h3>2. I want to access the full data set. What should I do?</h3>
                <p>
                    You should contact CREDO Science Coordinator (<a href="mailto:credodetector@credo.science">credodetector@credo.science</a>)
                    and describe why do you want access and what are you going to do with the data.
                    Remember to include your username and send the message from email address you used during
                    registration. <br>
